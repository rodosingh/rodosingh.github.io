##### Hypernym Discovery

Hypernymy, namely "is-a" relation, is a vital lexical-semantic relation in natural languages, which relates general terms to their instances or subtypes. In this relation, we name a specific instance or subtype hyponym and its related general term hypernym. For instance, **(apple, fruit)** is in hypernymy relation, where **apple** is a hyponym and **fruit** is one of its hypernyms. Or, for the input word "dog", some valid hypernyms would be "canine", "mammal" or "animal". (See <http://aclweb.org/anthology/S18-1116>).

**Here our objective would be as follows**:

Given an input term (or a hyponym $$q$$), our alogrithm need to retrieves a ranked list (possibly of length $$15$$) of its suitable hypernyms ($$h$$) from a large corpus.
