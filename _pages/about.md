#### Hey Voila! :wave:

I'm currently a Research Enginner @ AMD GenAI, where my focus is mostly on building in-house **LMMs (Large Multimodal Models)** 🤖. Previously, I was doing my MS by Research at [CVIT](https://cvit.iiit.ac.in/) Lab, [IIIT, Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/) 🏛️ and graduated in 2024. I was a part of the [Katha-AI](https://github.com/katha-ai) group where I had the privilege of working with [Prof. Makarand Tapaswi](https://makarandtapaswi.github.io/).

I am currently focusing 🎯 on RL, Diffusion, and partially, Efficient Training ⚡. Trying to 🔄 transition from my usual research area of **Multimodal Learning** 🎭.  
🔍 **My Past Projects:**  
📽️ [Multimodal Video Summarization on Long-form Videos](https://katha-ai.github.io/projects/recap-story-summ/)  
🎭 [Emotion Recognition of Movie Characters](https://katha-ai.github.io/projects/emotx/) using Video & Text Signals.

🛠️ **Before IIITH:**  
I was a Research Intern at [Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata](https://www.isical.ac.in/) (2020-21) 📍, where I worked with [Prof. B. Uma Shankar](https://www.isical.ac.in/~uma/) in the [Machine Intelligence Unit](https://www.isical.ac.in/~miu/) on topic **Multi-label Classification of Remote Sensing Images** 🛰️.  

📚 I graduated with an BS-MS degree in Mathematics & Statistics 📊 from [IISER Kolkata](https://www.iiserkol.ac.in/) in 2021.  

In my spare time, I enjoy playing **badminton** 🏸, **swimming** 🏊, and sometimes **biking** 🏍️.  

⚡ Riding the wave of AGI innovation! 🚀
