#### Hey Voila! :wave:

I'm a second year Master's student at [CVIT](https://cvit.iiit.ac.in/) Lab, [International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/) under the supervision of [Prof. Makarand Tapaswi](https://makarandtapaswi.github.io/) in the Video-Language Group.

My research interests broadly lie in the intersection of Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing (Multi-modal Learning). Currently, I'm focusing on the challenge of Multimodal Video Summarization on Long-form Videos. Besides, we're also working on Emotion Recognition and Tracking from Video, Text, and Audio.

Before I joined IIITH, I was a Research Intern at [Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata](https://www.isical.ac.in/) (2020-21) under [Prof. B. Uma Shankar](https://www.isical.ac.in/~uma/) in the [Machine Intelligence Unit](https://www.isical.ac.in/~miu/) where I spent a wonderful semester working on Multi-label classification of Remote Sensing Images. I graduated with Integrated BS-MS degree in Mathematics and Statistics from [Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Kolkata](https://www.iiserkol.ac.in/) in 2021.

In my spare time, I enjoy doing sports (badminton, cycling, and running mostly), sometimes painting (btw have a look at my [insta page](https://www.instagram.com/rodo.arts/)), and cookingðŸ˜‰.
