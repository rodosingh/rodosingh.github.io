  title           = {Multi-Label Classification on Remote-Sensing Images},
  abstract        = {Acquiring information on large areas on the earth's surface through satellite cameras allows us to see much more than we can see while standing on the ground. This assists us in detecting and monitoring the physical characteristics of an area like land-use patterns, atmospheric conditions, forest cover, and many unlisted aspects. The obtained images not only keep track of continuous natural phenomena but are also crucial in tackling the global challenge of severe deforestation. Among which Amazon basin accounts for the largest share every year. Proper data analysis would help limit detrimental effects on the ecosystem and biodiversity with a sustainable healthy atmosphere. This report aims to label the satellite image chips of the Amazon rainforest with atmospheric and various classes of land cover or land use through different machine learning and superior deep learning models. Evaluation is done based on the F2 metric, while for loss function, we have both sigmoid cross-entropy as well as softmax cross-entropy. Images are fed indirectly to the machine learning classifiers after only features are extracted using pre-trained ImageNet architectures. Whereas for deep learning models, ensembles of fine-tuned ImageNet pre-trained models are used via transfer learning. Our best score was achieved so far with the F2 metric is 0.927.},

%   author={Einstein, A. and Podolsky, B. and Rosen, N.},
%   abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
