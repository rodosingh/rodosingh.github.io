        - <b>PROJECT 1:</b> <b>Long-from video summarization</b> via human-emotion recognition and tracking as well as auto key-points detection in long-form videos like web-series, and movies, which in itself is a novel research problem. It involves a novel way of auto-labeling multi-modal data samples. Further, the approach to fuse multi-modal signals and train our model to make sense of it is itself a very challenging task. <i>Paper arriving soon!</i>
        - <b><a href="https://katha-ai.github.io/projects/emotx/">PROJECT 2:</a></b> <b>[CVPR'23] - Learning emotion and mental states for movie characters</b> via joint-modeling on scene, characters and dialog modalities to predict more than one emotion or mental state (multi-label) for each character and the whole scene. Besides, we analysed the self-attention mechanism on how model learns to look at relevant modalities at the right time.

        - <b>PROJECT:</b> <b>Modeling and Reviewing</b> multi-label classification of highly imbalanced Amazon rainforest images via transfer learning using all possible fine-tuned pre-trained models used in ImageNet challenges till date. Plus, implemented & reviewed promising ML models (Random Forest, XGboost, GBC, etc.) on the same.
        - <b>Final touch:</b> Ensembled all the above ImageNet models in Integrated Stacking format and fine-tuned (Meta learning) to achieve the best result among all the tried out methods. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.01971">Article Link</a>
